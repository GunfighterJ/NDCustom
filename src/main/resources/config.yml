# Welcome to NDCustom, a public custom plugin for use on the NotoriousDev servers.
# This plugin has been custom built for the NotoriousDev servers, however it can
# be implemented on other servers with a little Java tweaking. This config file has
# all of the configurable options that the plugin uses, so make sure that all of
# the options are set correctly, otherwise the plugin will not work as expected.

# Do you want the plugin enabled? (This is mainly used for when we are performing checks,
# hence why it is false be default).
